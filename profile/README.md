# VoxelStorm

VoxelStorm Ltd was an independent game studio running from 2012 to 2018, noted for building all its game engines from scratch.

VoxelStorm has been re-born as [Armchair Software](https://github.com/Armchair-Software), and the classic games are still available - see [voxelstorm.com](http://voxelstorm.com).

The plan is to gradually release all VoxelStorm code as open source, so long-term fans and the entire gamedev community can benefit.  Repositories containing open source VoxelStorm code are grouped here - explore!
